/// Project Steps for Networks Class /// 
These are the three steps we implemented for the Networks class with my partner, the project was basically
about a simple cloud system where server holds the files sent by clients and clients can download, rename, delete, 
upload the files they want. The code is written in C# which wasn't our main language when we started to work on this
project. So there can more than likely be some efficiency mistakes, and wrong use of built-in functions but the program
is working all fine.
